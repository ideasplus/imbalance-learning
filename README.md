# imbalance-learning
There are some algorithm implementations for learning from imbalanced data, including over-sampling, under-sampling, and boosting.

## 1. Oversampling
  * RandomOverSampling
  * SMOTE
  * Borderline-SMOTE1 and Borderline-SMOTE2
  * ADASYN
  * Safe-Level-SMOTE
  * MWMOTE
  * CGMOS

## 2. Undersampling
  * RandomUnderSampling
    
## 3. Boosting
  * SMOTEBoost
  * EasyEnsemble
  * BalanceCascade
  * RUSBoost
  
P.S. Some of the implementations are rewritten or further optimized based on the original author's codes.
