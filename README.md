# imbalance-learning
There are some algorithms for learning from imbalanced data,including over-sampling,under-sampling and boosting
## 1.oversampling
  * RandomOverSampling
  * SMOTE
  * Borderline-SMOTE1 and Borderline-SMOTE2
  * ADASYN
  * Safe-Level-SMOTE
  * MWMOTE
  * CGMOS
## 2.undersampling
  * RandomUnderSampling
## 3.boosting
  * SMOTEBoost
  * EasyEnsemble
  * BalanceCascade
  * RUSBoost
  
P.S. Some of algorithms are rewritten and do some opitimization based other people's implementation.
